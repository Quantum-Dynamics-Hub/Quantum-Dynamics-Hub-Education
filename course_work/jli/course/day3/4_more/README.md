At this point, these tutorials are simply moved from the Libra soruce distribution 
They are sufficiently well developed, but some road mapping is needed

Also, we potentially need to spread them out in different folders

Tutorial1 : constructing the exact TD-SE methods, using the HDF files produced by the code to plot the results
Tutorial2 : a compact version of Tutorial 1, via the use of the libra_py functions
Tutorial3 : more models and initial conditions
Tutorial4 : Tully's scattering problems - we now integrate populations spatially, to know the reflection/transmission populations
